 * Fetch Request is essentially an "proxy" class meant to wrap a standard Request

 *   auto-serialization of FormData, auto-filling X-CSRF-Token and a number of other
 *   niceties. The FetchRequest constructor follows the same conventions as fetch.
 *   It can either take in a Request object, or be giving a url and then an object
 *   with all the fetch options.
